The quick brown fox jumps.
An apple a day keeps.
She sells seashells by.
It's raining cats and dogs.
A watched pot never boils.
Birds of a feather flock.
Actions speak louder than words.
You can't judge a book.
A penny for your thoughts.
The early bird catches the.
A stitch in time saves.
Don't count your chickens before.
Every cloud has a silver.
All that glitters is not.
When in Rome, do as.
Easy come, easy go.
People who live in glass.
Too many cooks spoil the.
Two wrongs don't make a.
Beauty is in the eye.
You can't make an omelet.
Haste makes waste.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Don't put all your eggs.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
A watched kettle never boils.
Don't bite the hand.
The proof of the pudding.
If the shoe fits, wear.
Fools rush in where angels.
A rolling stone gathers no.
Home is where the heart.
Necessity is the mother of.
Don't cry over spilled milk.
Every dog has its day.
Practice makes perfect.
The early bird gets the.
Don't throw the baby out.
The grass is always greener.
Every rose has its thorn.
A chain is only as.
The road to hell is.
You can't have your cake.
Beggars can't be choosers.
The apple doesn't fall far.
All is fair in love.
There's no smoke without fire.
The bigger they are, the.
Don't look a gift horse.
The way to a man's.
You're a snake in the.
If the cap fits, wear.
What goes around comes around.
A picture is worth a.
Still waters run deep.
The devil is in the.
Better late than never.
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
Beauty is only skin deep.
You can lead a horse.
Charity begins at home.
The best things in life.
Don't rock the boat.
Where there is life, there.
Every man has his price.
Blood is thicker than water.
A friend in need is.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Where there's muck, there's brass.
The pen is mightier than.
If it ain't broke, don't.
Don't put all your eggs.
You scratch my back, I'll.
A bad workman blames his.
The pot calling the kettle.
A fool and his money.
A change is as good.
Every cloud has a silver.
You can't make an omelet.
Beauty is in the eye.
Haste makes waste.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Don't put all your eggs.
